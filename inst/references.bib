  abstract = {Using a standard 4-variable linear vector error correction model (VECM), we first show that the null hypothesis of linearity can be strongly rejected against the alternative of smooth transition autoregressive nonlinearity. An important result from this stage of the analysis is that the quarterly growth rate of money is identified as the transition variable, the variable which governs the smooth switching between regimes. This implies there is a nonlinear causal relationship between money and output. A smooth transition VECM (STVECM) is then used to examine whether money nonlinearly Granger causes output in the sense that lagged values of money enter the model's output equation as regressors. We evaluate this type of nonlinear Granger causality with both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. For the in-sample analysis we compare alternative models using predictive accuracy tests. These results vary strongly across use of the AIC and SIC. Our use of an out-of-sample forecasting exercise to study money-income Granger causality, both linear and nonlinear, we believe is new to the literature. The forecasting results do not suggest that money is nonlinearly Granger causal for output. In fact, they show that by allowing money to nonlinearly Granger cause output, the forecasting performance of the STVECM is significantly worsened.},

The results on simulating the size show that these tests generally suffer from positive size distortion. We find that both Wilks's ? and Rao's F statistic, the latter in particular, have satisfactory size properties and can generally be recommended for empirical use. The local asymptotic power and finite sample power properties of these tests are studied as well. JEL Classification: C12, C32, C52},

The bivariate single-transition vector smooth transition regression model of Camacho (2004) is generalised to a multivariate and multitransition one. A modelling strategy consisting of specification, including testing linearity, estimation and evaluation of these models is constructed. Nonlinear least squares estimation of the parameters of the model is discussed. Evaluation by misspecification tests is carried out using tests derived in a companion paper. The use of the modelling strategy is illustrated by two applications. In the first one, the dynamic relationship between the US gasoline price and consumption is studied and possible asymmetries in it considered. The second application consists of modelling two well known Icelandic riverflow series, previously considered by many hydrologists and time series analysts. JEL Classification: C32, C51, C52},

  abstract = {This textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students presents the theory of matrix algebra for statistical applications, explores various types of matrices encountered in statistics, and covers numerical linear algebra. Matrix algebra is one of the most important areas of mathematics in data science and in statistical theory, and the second edition of this very popular textbook provides essential updates and comprehensive coverage on critical topics in mathematics in data science and in statistical theory. Part I offers a self-contained description of relevant aspects of the theory of matrix algebra for applications in statistics. It begins with fundamental concepts of vectors and vector spaces; covers basic algebraic properties of matrices and analytic properties of vectors and matrices in multivariate calculus; and concludes with a discussion on operations on matrices in solutions of linear systems and in eigenanalysis. Part II considers various types of matrices encountered in statistics, such as projection matrices and positive definite matrices, and describes special properties of those matrices; and describes various applications of matrix theory in statistics, including linear models, multivariate analysis, and stochastic processes. Part III covers numerical linear algebra-one of the most important subjects in the field of statistical computing. It begins with a discussion of the basics of numerical computations and goes on to describe accurate and efficient algorithms for factoring matrices, how to solve linear systems of equations, and the extraction of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Although the book is not tied to any particular software system, it describes and gives examples of the use of modern computer software for numerical linear algebra. This part is essentially self-contained, although it assumes some ability to program in Fortran or C and/or the ability to use R or Matlab. The first two parts of the text are ideal for a course in matrix algebra for statistics students or as a supplementary text for various courses in linear models or multivariate statistics. The third part is ideal for use as a text for a course in statistical computing or as a supplementary text for various courses that emphasize computations. New to this edition - 100 pages of additional material - 30 more exercises-186 exercises overall - Added discussion of vectors and matrices with complex elements - Additional material on statistical applications - Extensive and reader-friendly cross references and index},
